## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### Option 1: With PostgreSQL (Recommended)
1. **Install PostgreSQL** if you haven't already
2. **Create the database**:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE inventory_db;
   ```
3. **Update credentials** in `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties` if needed:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.username=postgres
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```

### Option 2: With H2 Database (Quick Start)
If you don't want to install PostgreSQL, you can use the H2 file-based database:

1. **Edit** `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties`
2. **Comment out** the PostgreSQL lines (add `#` at the beginning):
   ```properties
   #spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/inventory_db
   #spring.datasource.username=postgres
   #spring.datasource.password=password
   #spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver
   ```
3. **Uncomment** the H2 lines (remove `#`):
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:file:./data/inventory
   spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
   spring.datasource.username=sa
   spring.datasource.password=password
   spring.h2.console.enabled=true
   spring.h2.console.path=/h2-console
   ```

### Start the Application
1. **Backend**: Use VS Code task "Run Spring Boot Backend" or:
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   .\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
   ### üöÄ **Latest Updates - July 26, 2025**

#### üÜï **New Features Added**
1. **Product Discontinuation System** 
   - Mark products as discontinued/active with status badges
   - Discontinue/reactivate actions in product management
   - Visual status indicators with color-coded chips

2. **Settings Dialog (Replaces Connection Test Box)**
   - Clean settings icon in products header
   - Organized dialog with connection testing and test product creation
   - Better user experience with modal interface

3. **Enhanced Dashboard Charts**
   - Toggle between "Revenue Trend" and "Quantity Sold Trend" charts
   - Dynamic chart labels and tooltips
   - Smart y-axis formatting for both data types
   - Updated percentage change calculations

4. **Improved Product Management**
   - "More Actions" menu with organized options
   - Status column showing Active/Discontinued
   - Enhanced UI with better visual hierarchy

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Database Schema Update Required**
The new features require a `discontinued` column in the `product` table. If you encounter the error:
```
ERROR: column p1_0.discontinued does not exist
```

**Solution Options:**
1. **Use H2 Database (Recommended for testing)**: Already configured in application.properties
2. **PostgreSQL Users**: Add column manually with: `ALTER TABLE product ADD COLUMN discontinued BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;`
3. **Or temporarily use create-drop**: Change `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop` (‚ö†Ô∏è deletes data)

./mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
   ```

2. **Frontend**: Use VS Code task "Run React Frontend" or:
   ```powershell
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
